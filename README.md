# chat_application
It is simple chat application using Node, Express and Socket IO. I worked on this throrough a Node JS course on LinkedIn learning.
 
It features: 
	HTTP requests made from the front end to the back end, 
	Web sockets through Socket.IO, which allows for automatic push notifications from the server to the client. 
	MongoDB and mLab to make our data persist 


Functionalities: 
	We can post a new message and it will automatically show up in our client, and in the second client as well, and vice versa. 
	we can open up as many clients as we like, and it will scale. 
	We can even restart our clients, and the data will still show.
